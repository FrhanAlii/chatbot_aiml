  <category>
    <pattern>WHAT IS A FEEDFORWARD NEURAL NETWORK *</pattern>
    <template>
      A Feedforward Neural Network is a basic type of neural network where connections between nodes do not form cycles, and data flows in one direction from input to output.
    </template>
  </category>

  <category>
    <pattern>WHAT IS AN ENSEMBLE METHOD *</pattern>
    <template>
      Ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models to improve overall performance, such as bagging, boosting, and stacking.

  </category>

  <category>
    <pattern>EXPLAIN GRADIENT VANISHING PROBLEM *</pattern>
    <template>
      The gradient vanishing problem occurs when gradients become too small during backpropagation, making it difficult for a neural network to learn, often seen in deep networks.
    </template>
  </category>

  <category>
    <pattern>WHAT IS DATA AUGMENTATION *</pattern>
    <template>
      Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of training data by applying transformations, such as rotations and scaling, to existing data.

  <category>
    <pattern>WHAT IS THE ROLE OF REGULARIZATION *</pattern>
    <template>
      Regularization techniques, such as L1, L2, and dropout, are used to reduce overfitting by penalizing complex models and encouraging simplicity.
