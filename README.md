Chatbot Powered by AIML, NLTK, Prolog, and Neo4j
Welcome to the repository for my AI-Powered Chatbot! ðŸš€ This project combines the power of Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML), Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Prolog, and Neo4j to deliver a robust and intelligent conversational experience.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features
AIML-Powered Conversational Engine:

Uses AIML to handle predefined conversational patterns and responses.
Enables natural, human-like interactions with minimal setup.


Natural Language Processing with NLTK:
Processes and tokenizes user input for semantic understanding.
Includes features like text preprocessing and keyword extraction.


Prolog for Logical Reasoning:
Incorporates Prolog for rule-based reasoning and decision-making, allowing the chatbot to handle complex queries.


Neo4j for Graph-Based Data:
Uses Neo4j to store and manage connected data like user knowledge, chatbot responses, and relationships between concepts.
Note: Database setup is not included in the repository. Users must configure their own Neo4j database locally.


ðŸš€ Technologies Used
AIML: For structured and rule-based conversation design.
NLTK: For natural language processing and analysis.
Prolog: For logic-based reasoning and problem-solving.
Neo4j: For graph-based data storage and traversal.
Python: As the core programming language.
